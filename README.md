# NumberToRomanConvertor

The Romans wrote numbers using letters : I, V, X, L, C, D, M.
The Kata says to write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg

     1 --> I
     5 --> V
     7 --> VII
     10 --> X
     50 --> L
     100 --> C
     500 --> D
     1000 --> M

     There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000.
